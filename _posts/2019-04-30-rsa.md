Given the importance of the web, one has to understand the security aspect underlying the web's architecture. Secure pages generally uses SSL/TLS to establish a secure connection channel between the client and the server. TLS (transport layer security) is the current protocol as SSL (secure sockets layer) is currently being phased out for TLS.  
When one connects to one's banking system, one needs to be sure that the transport channel is encrypted. TLS allows this encryption using a multi-steps protocol. RSA is used in the first step of this protocol.  
1. The client connects to the server using its url . (eg: https:www.mybank.com) Notice the https which specifies the use of TLS.  
2. The server sends a public key to the client. This key is then automatically validated by the client using a certification authority (CA).
3. Using RSA, the client uses the server's public key along with its own private key to send a key. This key will be used for the rest of the communication. This key will allow symmetrical encryption for the rest of the communication. Symmetrical encryption is much faster than assymetrical encryption.  

Here, we will focus on the assymetrical part of the TLS protocol where RSA is used. It is assymetric because it uses a pair of different keys (public, private). I will show you how to implement the RSA algorithm.  
The reason RSA works so well is that it is extremely hard to find the factors of a large composite number. Here our factors will be prime number. This problem is called prime factorization.  
We will need the bare minimum in terms of module.  
```Python
import random
import math
```  
Fundamentally, RSA requires two huge prime numbers. The first step is to generate these 2 prime numbers. To get two prime numbers we will randomly test numbers until we get 2 of them which are prime. Let's start with this step!  
BUT! We need one function before. This function will compute the exponent of a number much faster than the naive `x**y` implementation.
```python
def squareAndMultiply(x:int, H:int, n:int) -> int:
    """
    This method computes the exponent of a number (with the modulo
    operation applied). It uses a faster way than the naive method:
    The exponent is decomposed in the following manner:
        (using the example x=2, H=5, n=1000)
        H -> 101 (in binary)
        result = ((x^2)^2 * x)
    Args:
        x (int): the base of the exponentiation
        H (int): the exponent
        n (int): the modulo to apply
    Returns:
        (int): the result of the exponent operator
    """
    r = x
    # get rid of the two first bits (0b)
    h = bin(H)[2:]
    # forego the first term of the array h to get the 
    # appropriate number of operations to apply
    for i in range(1, len(h)):
        r = pow(r, 2, n)
        # when the current bit is one, also multiply by initial val.
        if h[i] == '1':
            r = (r*x) % n
    return r
```
This method will be used in the Miller-Rabin algorithm. The Miller-Rabin algorithm is used to check if a number is prime or not.  

```python
def millerRabin(n: int, s: int) -> bool:
    """
    Probabilistic version of the miller algorithm. 
    Args:
        n (int): number to test 
        s (int): number of rounds of testing, this `s` can be 
                 considered the precision.
    Returns:
        (bool): returns True if n is most probably a prime, else
                returns False
    """
    # 0,1,2,3 are prime
    if n <= 3:
        return True

    # alternate representation of n
    # n = 2^u * r + 1 (r is odd)
    u = 0
    r = n - 1
    while r & 1 == 0:
        u += 1
        r >>= 1
    
    # iterate on the number of tries
    for _ in range(s):
        # try a random number `a` and 
        # check if this number is prime
        a = random.randint(2, n - 2)
        z = squareAndMultiply(a, r, n)
        if z == 1:
            continue

        # assume a is composite and return if it is not
        returnComposite = True
        for i in range(u):
            if squareAndMultiply(a, 2**i * r, n) == n - 1:
                returnComposite = False
                break
        # if the above loop did not break, then it is 
        # a composite number
        if returnComposite:
            return False
    return True
```
Now that we have the tools to check for primality, we need one more thing before generating the pair of keys. We need the ability
to compute the greatest common divisor between two numbers, as well as the first coefficient of Bezout's identity. Remember that:  
Bézout's identity — Let $$a$$ and $$b$$ be integers with greatest common divisor $$d$$. Then, there exist integers $$x$$ and $$y$$ such that $$ax + by = d$$. More generally, the integers of the form $$ax + by$$ are exactly the multiples of $$d$$. 
```python
def EEA(a: int, b: int) -> Tuple[int, int, int]:
    """
    This is the classic extended euclidean algorithm. 
    Args:
        a (int): First number
        b (int): Second number
    Returns:
        tuple<int, int, int>: A tuple of 3 numbers. The
        first number is the greatest common divisor between
        `a` and `b`. The second number is the first Bezout 
        coefficient and the thirs number is the second Bezout
        coefficient.
    """
    v = 0
    vprime = 1
    u = 1
    uprime = 0
    while a != 0:
        q, b, a = b // a, a, b % a
        u, uprime = uprime, u - q * uprime
        v, vprime = vprime, v - q * vprime
    return b, v, u
```
Fortunately, we can generate the keys. One decides on one piece of the key: $$e$$, the rest is automatically (and randomly) generated.
```python
def genKeys(e: int = 17) -> Tuple[Tuple[int, int], Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    """
    This function generates a set of (public key, private key)
    from the extended euclidean algorithm and the miller rabin
    algorithm for primality checking.
    Args:
        e (int): choosen integer that forms a part of the 
                 public key. Normally, 3, 5, 17 and 65535 are
                 popular values
    Returns:
        tuple of the public key ( n, e) and the private key
            (n, d, p, q)
    """
    found_pq = False
    p, q = -1, -1
    while not found_pq:
        p_prime, q_prime = False, False
        # generate random p value until
        # p is found to be prime
        while not p_prime:
            x = random.getrandbits(512)
            p_prime = millerRabin(x, 4)
            if p_prime:
                p = x
        # generate random value until 
        # q is found to be prime
        while not q_prime:
            x = random.getrandbits(512)
            q_prime = millerRabin(x, 4)
            if q_prime:
                q = x
        
        # keep the gcd and the first bezout number
        phi = (p - 1) * (q-1)
        gcd, d, _ = EEA(e, phi)
        if gcd == 1 and d > 0:
            found_pq = True
    n = p*q
    public_key = (n, e)
    private_key = (n, d, p, q)
    return (public_key, private_key)
```
We now have a pair of public key and private key! Let's verify that the generate keys algorithm worked by coding
an encryption and decryption function.  
The encryption is pretty simple, we encrypt the message with the function $$c = m^e mod n$$. Where $$m$$ is the plain message, and $$(n, e)$$ forms the public key.  
```python
def encrypt(public_key: Tuple[int, int], plaintext: str) -> int:
    """
    Encrypts a message using the public key.
    Converts the message to utf-8, then gets the bytes,
    then converts these bytes to int
    and finally multiply by the parameters of the public key.
    Args:
        public_key (Tuple[int, int]): the public key which consists
            of the pair (n, e)
        plaintext (str) the plaintext one wishes to encrypt.
    Returns:
        (int): encrypted text as an integet
    """
    n, e = public_key
    # encodes in utf-8 by default
    xbytes = plaintext.encode()
    xhex = xbytes.hex()
    xint = int(xhex, base=16)
    y = squareAndMultiply(xint, e, n)
    return y
```
The decryption works in a similar way. Now, the formula is $$m = c^d mod n$$, where $$(n, d, p, q)$$ is the private key and $$c$$ is the encrypted message.  
```python
def decrypt(private_key: Tuple[int, int, int, int],
            ciphertext: int) -> str:
    """
    Decrypts the ciphertext which is an int using the 
    RSA private key (more specifically the two first
    elements of the private key (n & d).
    Args:
        private_key (Tuple[int, int, int, int]):
            the RSA private key (n, d, p, q)
        ciphertext (int): the encrypted text formed
            as an integer.
    Returns:
        (str): The decrypted text.
    """
    n, d, _, _ = private_key
    xint = squareAndMultiply(ciphertext, d, n)
    # int -> hex -> bytes -> str
    xhex = hex(xint)
    xstring = bytes.fromhex(xhex[2:])
    print(xstring)
    return xstring.decode()
```
Let's test the whole thing using a simple sentence:
```python
public_key, private_key = genKeys()
encrypted_text = encrypt(public_key, "jack of all trade")
print(decrypt(private_key, encrypted_text))
------
b'jack of all trade'
jack of all trade

```
