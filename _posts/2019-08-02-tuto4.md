#  Functions in Python
## Introduction

> Functions are a very important part of Python. We can use them to create general, configurable and repeatable pieces
>of code. In this tutorial, we will explore the syntax and the features of Python's functions. We will also learn how
>to use them and what are good practices associated to Python functions. In previous tutorials, we already saw few
>functions like ```print(), len() ...   ```



```python
print(12)
len([12,3,4])
```

    12





    3



> Let's start by defining our own functions. The syntax is the following:
```
def function_name(parameters):
      function body
```

> So, you can choose any name that does not contain any funky characters. Only the underscore, letters and numbers 
>are allowed. Also note that you may not start your function with a number. The parameters are surrounded by 
>parenthesis and are the inputs to your function. You might have no parameters just like you might have 10. The 
>function body is split from the definition line (called the function signature) by indentation. In Python, it is 
>good practice to give your function good lengthy precise names. The following is a good example: 
 ```
 def test_outbound_call_generating_valid_number_of_values(...):
    ...
 ```
 
 > It is important to notice the colon after the list of parameters. 
 


```python
# notice the pass keyword, it's use when we want an empty function.
def first_function():
    pass

def addition(number_1, number_2):
    result = number_1 + number_2
    return result
addition(12, 15)
```




    27




```python
def multiplication(number_1, number_2):
    total = 0
    for _ in range(number_2):
        total = addition(total, number_1)
    return total
multiplication(4, 8)
```

> As seen in this previous example, functions can call other functions, they can also take other functions as input 
>and return functions. Very versatile!

### Exercise!
> Write a function that computes the absolute value of any number.


```python
import random

def my_abs(input_number):
    pass

# generate 20 random numbers from -100 to 100
test_numbers = random.sample(range(-100, 100), 20)

for random_number in test_numbers:
    assert my_abs(random_number) == abs(random_number)
```

    89
    -46
    -96
    72
    44
    21
    -51
    83
    94
    2
    -70
    10
    -58
    -11
    -75
    -87
    17
    22
    -95
    -78


## Return Values
> Once again, Python offers us a lot of options, this time for return values. Just keep in mind, we don't have to return
>anything, it is optional. If we don't specify any return values, the value ```None``` is returned. You also might want
>to use the ```return``` keyword in order to stop your function following a conditional statement.



```python
def print_horse():
    print("""\

                                       ._ o o
                                       \_`-)|_
                                    ,""       \ 
                                  ,"  ## |   ಠ ಠ. 
                                ," ##   ,-\__    `.
                              ,"       /     `--._;)
                            ,"     ## /
                          ,"   ##    /


                    """)

print_horse()
x = print_horse() 
print('What was the value returned by the function?: {}'.format(x))
```

    
                                           ._ o o
                                           \_`-)|_
                                        ,""       \ 
                                      ,"  ## |   ಠ ಠ. 
                                    ," ##   ,-\__    `.
                                  ,"       /     `--._;)
                                ,"     ## /
                              ,"   ##    /
    
    
                        
    
                                           ._ o o
                                           \_`-)|_
                                        ,""       \ 
                                      ,"  ## |   ಠ ಠ. 
                                    ," ##   ,-\__    `.
                                  ,"       /     `--._;)
                                ,"     ## /
                              ,"   ##    /
    
    
                        
    What was the value returned by the function?: None


> We can return multiple values at once from a function, they will automatically take the shape of a tuple. This can 
>be very useful, but keep in mind that it is generally considered bad python practice to return multiple values from 
>one single function.



```python
def element_in_list(el, _list):
    found_index = -1
    found = False
    for i, list_element in enumerate(_list):
        if list_element == el:
            found_index = i
            found = True
            break
    return found, found_index

element_in_list(9, [1,2,3,5,9])
```




    (True, 4)



> Note that you can also return functions from a function.


```python
def hello():
    def say_hi_fct():
        return "Hi"
    return say_hi_fct

say_hi_var = hello() # say_hi function is assign to the function variable
say_hi_var()

```




    'Hi'



### Exercise !
> Write a Python function that takes a list and returns a new list with unique elements of the first list as well as 
>the proportion of unique elements that were found in the input list over the number of elements of the input list.



```python
def unique_elements(input_list):
    pass


ans1 = unique_elements([6,13,15,13,67,1,1,1,1])
ans1[0].sort()
assert ans1[0] == [1, 6, 13, 15, 67] 
assert ans1[1] == 5/9
```

## Parameters and Default Parameters
> There exist two types of parameters in python, required parameters, and default/keyword parameters. 
> I might interchange arguments and parameters when I talk, as the distinction is not very rigorous. However, they 
>have slightly different meanings as an argument refers to the VALUE passed to the function while a parameter refers 
>to the VARIABLE passed to a function.



```python
def my_function(required_arg, default_args="Okay hey"):
    print("my parameters are {} and {}".format(required_arg, default_args))

# normal call to "my_function"
my_function('Hello')

# This call will throw a function as the required parameter is not filled
try:
    my_function()
except Exception as e:
    print(str(e))

# calling the function with another parameter instead of the default parameter
my_function("bonjour", "hi")

# when we use the name of the parameters in the function call, we can switch up their names with no problems
my_function(default_args="White", required_arg="Stripes")
```

    my parameters are Hello and Okay hey
    my_function() missing 1 required positional argument: 'required_arg'
    my parameters are bonjour and hi
    my parameters are Stripes and White


> As you start reading more and more Python code, you will frequently encounter the keywords "args" and "kwargs", 
>they are frequently used in the following manner:
```
def my_fct(*args, **kwargs):
    fct_body
```
> Args is a diminutive for "arguments" while kwargs is a diminutive for "keyword arguments". Args is used to collect
> an arbitrary number of required parameters while kwargs is used the same way for optional keywords. Keep in the 
>mind that these "required" parameters are totally optional as well. It' just that in the current context, they have 
>the same form. Let's analyze how the "args" and "kwargs" work. 



```python
def my_new_function(*args, **kwargs):
    for i, arg in enumerate(args):
        print("argument #{}: {}".format(i, arg))
        
    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        print("argument's value {}, parameter's name : {}".format(key, value))

my_new_function('heyyy', 9, True, jack="Huncho", my_status=12)
```

    argument #0: heyyy
    argument #1: 9
    argument #2: True
    argument's value jack, parameter's name : Huncho
    argument's value my_status, parameter's name : 12


> Quickly, I am sure you all noticed the asterisk and the double asterisks before the args and the kwargs 
>parameters. These are the packing and unpacking operators, the single asterisk is used for iterators such as lists 
>and tuples while the doublle is used for dictionaries-like types.



```python
first_var = 9
second_var = "hi"

my_new_function(first_var, second_var)

my_dict = dict(first_var=first_var, second_var=second_var)

my_new_function(**my_dict)
```

    argument #0: 9
    argument #1: hi
    argument's value first_var, parameter's name : 9
    argument's value second_var, parameter's name : hi


> An important specification concerning parameters is that the positional parameters (required parameters) must 
>placed before keywords parameters.


```python
try:
    my_new_function(my_status="feeling good", 9, 12, [], "hey")
except SyntaxError as e:
    print(str(e))
```


      File "<ipython-input-60-9fc8d3e419b0>", line 2
        my_new_function(my_status="feeling good", 9, 12, [], "hey")
                                                 ^
    SyntaxError: positional argument follows keyword argument




```python
def useful_function(a, b, c=12, *args, **kwargs):
    print("a : {}".format(a))
    print("b: {}".format(b))
    print("c: {}".format(c))
    print("args: {}".format(args))
    print("kwargs: {}".format(kwargs))

useful_function("aaaaaaaaa", "bbbbbbbbbbbb", "cccccccc", "dddddddddd", "eeeeeeeeee", f="ff", g="gg")
```

## Docstrings
> It is widely known that reading code if often much more difficult that writing it. Eventually, your code will be 
>read by other people and will create a real impact. Try to make the life of these people as well as possible. The 
>first important trick is to write long and detailed variable and function names. Try to write as few comments as 
>possible.   
>Where you want to describe the logic of your program is in the function's docstring. The docstring is a 
>summary of the parameters a function requires, it's behaviour and logic as well as it's expected return value. Then,
> you can see the docstring generated with the ```help()``` function.  
> You can also generate a readthedocs using 
>sphynx which will automatically parse your docstrings. The following link is an example of what can be done:
> https://lifelines.readthedocs.io/en/latest/


```python
import math
help(math.sqrt)

help(abs)

help(pow)

```

> Docstrings are specified by long strings just after a function's signature.



```python
def my_complex_fct(list_to_be_processed, threshold):
    """
    This very complex function sums up the elements in a list.
    :param list_to_be_processed: list to be summed up, must be numbers!
    :param threshold: if an element of the list_to_be_processed is bigger than the 
    threshold, do not consider it
    :return: the sum of the elements in the list_to_be_processed
    """    
    _sum = 0
    for element in list_to_be_processed:
        if element < threshold:
            _sum += element
    return _sum

my_complex_fct([1,2,3,5,6], threshold=6)

help(my_complex_fct)
```

### Exercise!
> Complete the body of the following function according to its docstring. HINT: Python has a builtin function `round`



```python
def round_to_two_places(num):
    """Return the given number rounded to two decimal places. 
    
    >>> round_to_two_places(3.14159)
    3.14
    """
    # Replace this body with your own code.
    # ("pass" is a keyword that does literally nothing. We used it as a placeholder
    # because after we begin a code block, Python requires at least one line of code)
    pass

assert round_to_two_places(3.14159) == 3.14
assert round_to_two_places(0) == 0 
assert round_to_two_places(-99999.99999) == -100000.0
```

## Global and Local Scopes
> Let's get into a slightly more tricky subject and talk about the variables' scopes in Python. This section might 
>save you a lot of headache in the future while debugging your code, so pay attention!  
>Let's start by defining and understanding scopes. A scope is essentially a dictionary-like object of variables along 
>with their values for a certain body of code. 



```python
x = 99
y = 88

def dummy_fct():
    x = "Totally different value"
    y = "Another totally different value"
    print("local variables (local scope) is {}".format(locals()))

dummy_fct()

# print only interesting variables from the global scope
print('global value of x: {}, global value of y: {}'.format(globals()['x'], globals()['y']))

```

> Notice how the local scope takes precedence over the global scope. Now, let's define a global variable that will be
> modified in the body of a function.




```python
dummy_var = 99

def modify_dummy_var():
    dummy_var = -2
    
modify_dummy_var()
dummy_var
    
```

> So, why was the value of dummy_var still 99 after we supposedly modified it to -2. Why is this so? The reason is we
> are actually defining dummy_var locally instead of modifying its global value. Notice:



```python
dummy_var = 99

def modify_dummy_var():
    dummy_var = -2
    print(locals())
    print("dummy var in globals: {}".format(globals()['dummy_var']))
    
modify_dummy_var()


```

> Okay, so what if I really want to modify the value of dummy_var inside our function? I need to use the global 
>keyword.



```python
dummy_var = 99

def modify_dummy_var():
    global  dummy_var
    dummy_var = -2
    print(locals())
    print("dummy var in globals: {}".format(globals()['dummy_var']))
    
modify_dummy_var()
```

> Voila! We can play with global variables inside of function now, but keep in mind that this is generally not 
>considered good practice in Python.
>
### Exercise!
> What does the following code print?
```
a_var = 'global variable'
def a_func():
    print(a_var, '[ a_var inside a_func() ]')
a_func()
print(a_var, '[ a_var outside a_func() ]')
```
> See the solution in the answer sheet.
