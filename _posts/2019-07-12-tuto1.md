#  Python Beginner Workshop 1

## Introduction to Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab
> In this workshop, we will be using Jupyter. Jupyter is a tool that allows us to write directly in our browser. Jupyter is very popular among data scientists as it allows us to visualize our data directly in our code.
> Jupyter Notebooks are ".ipynb" files instead of normal ".py" files. In fact, they work with IPython instead of Python ( IPython being a superset of Python):
> "IPython (Interactive Python) is a command shell for interactive computing in multiple programming languages, originally developed for the Python programming language, that offers introspection, rich media, shell syntax, tab completion, and history."  
Google Colab (the website you are currently on) uses IPYthon and Jupyter Notebooks. Jupyter notebooks are web applications which allows to write files that contain live code, equations, visualisations and text. 

#### Installing Python, required packages and Jupyter Lab
> 1. We start by installing Python at the following [url](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (select Python 3.7.3).
2. Verify that the intallation worked by looking up for Python in the Windows search bar. ![py_search](https://i.ibb.co/x8H7Db7/image.png)  
3. Download this current notebook.  ![ce_notebook](https://i.ibb.co/wBmYhR8/image.png)  
4. After you've downloaded this notebook, put it in a folder along with this [file](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1yWr_-NAVEynJrK8YIJIdYAruwAs56AfP).  
5. Open the _command prompt_ on windows or the terminal on Mac/Linux. and go the folder where you saved your jupyter notebook ![cmd](https://i.ibb.co/RvrQMC4/image.png)  
6. Download necessary packages with Pip.  ![pip](https://i.ibb.co/CMmnMCH/image.png)  
7. Open up this notebook on Jupyter lab.  ![lab](https://i.ibb.co/qjJcrB5/image.png)  
![lab2](https://i.ibb.co/5nNj32S/image.png)  


## How to properly use JupyterLab or Google Colab
> The trick is to properly segment our code into multiple cells in order to organize our work.
To create cells, click on the _+_ button in the toolbar at the top of the notebook. A cell can be of multiple types, its default type is code, but it can also contain markdown text. The dropbar at the end of the top menu allows you to choose which type is you cell. You will mostly use code cells.  
Cells are stacked on top of each others, so when you execute one cell, later cells can use the variables declared in this previous cell. 


```python
x = 3
```


```python
print(x)
```

    3


> The most important thing about a cell is its status in the current session. A cell can be executed, but it can also not be. For instance:  
![alt text](https://i.ibb.co/XZx7F8C/image.png)  
The empty square signifies that the cell has not been executed. Every time you restart your environment, or you close and open your notebook, all cells come back to this status. Here:  
![alt text](https://i.ibb.co/cXgYbwp/image.png)  
The first cell has been executed before the last one as $$ 1 < 2 $$. Thus, we have declared the variable $$x$$ and we can print its value with no problem. In the following example, the two cells have been executed in reverse order:  
![alt text](https://i.ibb.co/F48kHPp/image.png)  
We get an error as $$x$$ as not been declared before we attempt to print it.  
When working on Jupyter notebooks, you always have to remember the order you execute cells and if some variables you declare have not already been used in previous cells. You have to execute your cells in the good order to not get errors!.  
To execute a cell, you need to click on the *play* button on the top menu, or you can type *shift and enter*.  
![play](https://i.ibb.co/chR1JkB/image.png)


```python
print('please execute my cell!')
```

    please execute my cell!


## 1. Built-in Types and Basic Data Structures
### 1.1 Numerical types
> A data type creates a constraint on a variable, just like *format* in *excel*.  
> Two main types:
* integers -> int
* floating points (equivalent of decimals) -> float


```python
# this is a comment (starts with #)
"""
    this is a multi-lines comment
"""
'''
    this is also a multi-lines comment
'''

x = 3
y = 1.5
z = x / y
print("x / y = {}".format(z)) # print is a function and the parenthesis afterwards specify inputs
```

    x / y = 2.0


> Numerical types type casting and conversion are implicitely made by the interpreter. In the last cell, the result of the division ($$z$$) is 2.0 and not 2. By default, an integer will be cast to a float when it is part of operations containing other floats.


```python
intz = int(z)
print("int(z) = ".format(intz))

floatz = float(intz)
print("z's new value after its conversion from float to int ".format(floatz))

x_negative = -4
x_positive = abs(x_negative) # abs stands for absolute value
print("absolute value in python = {}".format(x_positive))


exponent = x ** 2

exponent == pow(x, 2) # pow for power
```

    int(z) = 
    z's new value after its conversion from float to int 
    absolute value in python = 4





    True



### 1.2 Boolean values (bool)
> Boolean values are either  
```
False
True
```  
They are very useful for loops and control flows which will be seen later.


```python
variable_false = False
variable_true = True

# boolean values can be converted to numbers
variable_false_as_a_number = float(variable_false)
variable_true_as_a_number = int(variable_true)

print("variable_false as a number: {}".format(variable_false_as_a_number))
print("variable_true as a number: {}".format(variable_true_as_a_number))

```

    variable_false as a number: 0.0
    variable_true as a number: 1


> In the previous cell, we use what is called "variable casting" or "typecasting". This is the conversion of one data type to another. Here, we converted a boolean value to a number. This will be useful later on.

### 1.3 Strings (str)
> Strings are immutable sequences of characters in Unicode. Strings can be declared in the three following ways:  
* single quotes: ``` 'Hey, how are you doing' ```  
* double quotes: ``` "Good, yourself?" ```
* triple quotes: ``` """ thanks thanks """, ''' coool! ''' ```  
Triple quotes can be used for multi-lines strings


```python
nationality = 'Canadian'
name = 'erik'

'Hi my name is {} and I am {}'.format(name, nationality)
```




    'Hi my name is erik and I am Canadian'




```python
# there exists numerous built-in methods for strings
mad = "I am very mad"
mad.upper()
```




    'I AM VERY MAD'



> strings can be manipulated using "indexing" and "slicing". *Indexable data types and strings start at position 0!*. This is different from languages used by math people such as $$R$$ where indexing starts at position 1.


```python
print(mad[0]) # returns the first character of the string mad (I)
print(mad[2]) # returns the third character of the string mad (a)
print(mad[-1]) # returns the last character of the string mad (d)
                # because -0 makes no sense, right
print(mad[-2]) # returns the penultimate character (a)
```

    I
    a
    d
    a


> Surprisingly, some numerical operations can be applied to strings (like addition and multiplication)


```python
very_mad = mad * 2
print(very_mad)
chill = " but I am still chill nonetheless"
print(mad + chill)
```

    I am very madI am very mad
    I am very mad but I am still chill nonetheless


#### Exercise 1
> Write the word "love" from the sentence "I owe my friends all I have." using indexing and string additions.


```python
sentence = "I owe my friends all I have."
def exercise1(sentence):
    var_love = None # modify this variable
                # you can create new variables as well
    return var_love

assert exercise1(sentence) == "love"
```


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    AssertionError                            Traceback (most recent call last)

    <ipython-input-22-5bb3da9890bf> in <module>
          5     return var_love
          6 
    ----> 7 assert exercise1(sentence) == "love"
    

    AssertionError: 


> We can also use the slicing operation in order to retrieve strings from other strings


```python
my_sentence = """I walk through the valley of the shadow of death. 
    I fear no evil because I'm blind to it all. """
walk = my_sentence[2:6]
blind = my_sentence[-18:-12]
walking_where = my_sentence[0:25]
walk, blind, walking_where
```




    ('walk', ' blind', 'I walk through the valley')




```python
# Notice that my_sentence[0:25] == my_sentence[:25]
assert walking_where == my_sentence[:25]
```

#### Exercise 2
> Retrieve the sentence "somewhere is the Truth" from the sentence  
"Truth is you can stop and stare
Bled myself out and no one cares
Dug a trench out, laid down there
With a shovel up out of reach somewhere".


```python
sentence = """Truth is you can stop and stare
Bled myself out and no one cares
Dug a trench out, laid down there
With a shovel up out of reach somewhere"""

def exercise2(sentence):
    x = None # modify and return this variable 
            # you can define more variables
    return x

assert exercise2(sentence) == "somewhere is the Truth"

```


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    AssertionError                            Traceback (most recent call last)

    <ipython-input-25-ae755ba49ce9> in <module>
          9     return x
         10 
    ---> 11 assert exercise2(sentence) == "somewhere is the Truth"
    

    AssertionError: 


### 1.4 Lists
> A list is a collection which is mutable (can be changed) and ordered. A list allows duplicate members. As seen with strings (which can also be seen as a collection of characters), slicing and indexing can be used on lists.


```python
my_list = ["element1", False, 99]
first_element = my_list[0]
print('first element: {}'.format(first_element))
last_element = my_list[-1]
print('last element: {}'.format(last_element))
new_list = my_list[:2]

assert new_list == my_list[0:2]
new_list
```

    first element: element1
    last element: 99





    ['element1', False]



> We can iteratively add elements to a list with the *append* function


```python
print("new list: {}".format(new_list))
new_list.append("new element")
new_list
```

    new list: ['element1', False]





    ['element1', False, 'new element']



> There is the *len* function to get the size of a list.


```python
len(new_list)
```




    3



#### Exercise 3:
> Retrieve a list consisting of the last three elements of this long list.


```python
random_list = [
    'Email:',
    'SSN:',
    'Address:',
    'Home Phone:',
    'Mobile Phone: ',
    'DOB:',
    'Date of Surgery:',
    'Date of Service:',
    'Facility of Service:',
    'Clinic Number:',
    'Employer:',
    'Work Phone: ',
    'Fax: ',
    'Type:',
    'IPA:',
    'Health Plan:',
    'ID #:',
    'Claims Address:',
    'Group #:',
    'Claim # / PO #:',
    'Phone:',
    'Fax:',
    'Contact',
    'Adjuster Email',
    'Util Review Phone',
    'Util Review Fax',
    'Doctor:',
    'NPI #: ',
    'Date of Injury: ',
    'Body Parts:',
    'Body Part Side:',
    'Gender:',
    'Diagnosis:',
    'Diagnosis 2:',
    'Procedure:'
    ]

def exercise3(l):
    x = None # modify this variable
    return x

assert exercise3(random_list) == ['Diagnosis:', 'Diagnosis 2:', 'Procedure:'] 
```


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    AssertionError                            Traceback (most recent call last)

    <ipython-input-29-43c43612d698> in <module>
         41     return x
         42 
    ---> 43 assert exercise3(random_list) == ['Diagnosis:', 'Diagnosis 2:', 'Procedure:']
    

    AssertionError: 


### 1.5 Tuples
> Tuples are like mini lists that cannot be modified and often contains only a few elements. Tuples allow for duplicates and are ordered. Tuples are often used as return values when we want to return multiple things from one function.



```python
x = 4
my_tuple = (x, 5, 'hello')
my_tuple
```




    (4, 5, 'hello')




```python
# first element of the tuple
my_tuple[0]
```




    4




```python
# two last elements of the tuple
my_tuple[1: len(my_tuple)]
```




    (5, 'hello')




```python
# "unpacking" a tuple
element1, element2, _ = my_tuple
element1, element2
```




    (4, 5)



#### Exercise 4:
> Return a tuple of three elements from one input number. The first of these is the number divided by 2. The second one is the $$int$$ value of the input number. The third element is the input number to its fourth power.


```python
numb = 9.32
def exercise4(numb):
    x = None
    return x

assert exercise4(numb) == (4.66, 9, 7545.0765337600005)
```


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    AssertionError                            Traceback (most recent call last)

    <ipython-input-34-4c7af1353680> in <module>
          4     return x
          5 
    ----> 6 assert exercise4(numb) == (4.66, 9, 7545.0765337600005)
    

    AssertionError: 


### 1.6 Dictionaries
> Dictionaries are very important in Python. They are a collection of key-value pairs. Dictionaries are unordered, changeable and indexed. Dictionaries do not allow for duplicate keys. 


```python
my_empty_dictionary = {}
my_dictionary = {
    'key 1': 9,
    'key 2': 'hec',
    'key 3': [1.43, 6, 77],
    'key 4': (132, 'l')
}
my_dictionary
```




    {'key 1': 9, 'key 2': 'hec', 'key 3': [1.43, 6, 77], 'key 4': (132, 'l')}



> Dictionaries values and keys can be returned in different manners.


```python
value1 = my_dictionary['key 1']
print('the value associated to "key 1": {}'.format(value1))
all_keys = my_dictionary.keys()
print('keys set: {}'.format(all_keys))
all_values = my_dictionary.values()
print('values set: {}'.format(all_values))
all_pairs = my_dictionary.items()
all_pairs
```

    the value associated to "key 1": 9
    keys set: dict_keys(['key 1', 'key 2', 'key 3', 'key 4'])
    values set: dict_values([9, 'hec', [1.43, 6, 77], (132, 'l')])





    dict_items([('key 1', 9), ('key 2', 'hec'), ('key 3', [1.43, 6, 77]), ('key 4', (132, 'l'))])



> If a key does not exist, an error is returned.


```python
my_dictionary['missing key']
```


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    KeyError                                  Traceback (most recent call last)

    <ipython-input-37-69c646a63fb0> in <module>
    ----> 1 my_dictionary['missing key']
    

    KeyError: 'missing key'


> However, we can always add this key along with a value, if it has found to be missing. 


```python
if 'missing key' not in my_dictionary:
    my_dictionary['missing key'] = 'whatever value'
my_dictionary
```




    {'key 1': 9,
     'key 2': 'hec',
     'key 3': [1.43, 6, 77],
     'key 4': (132, 'l'),
     'missing key': 'whatever value'}



#### Exercise 5
> Form a dictionary having another dictionary has one of its value. In this other dictionary, add the pair 'key 1': 'value 1'. Then, return the value in this pair


```python
outer_dictionary = {}

# start by adding the filled inner dictionary to the outer dictionary


def exercise5(d):
    x = None
    return x

assert exercise5(outer_dictionary) == 'value 1'
```


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    AssertionError                            Traceback (most recent call last)

    <ipython-input-39-f450741f7cab> in <module>
          8     return x
          9 
    ---> 10 assert exercise5(outer_dictionary) == 'value 1'
    

    AssertionError:
