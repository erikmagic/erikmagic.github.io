#### This blog:
This blog showcase some of the projects I worked on during the last couple of years.

#### Me:
I studied software engineering at McGill university. My first few internships were in web development. Then, I got interested in A.I. As such, I started a professional master in machine learning at MILA (Yoshua Bengio's institute of machine learning). I am currently a data scientist at the National Bank of Canada where I also do a lot of data engineering.  
Even though I did very well in school, I realised there is still so much to learn and school does not sufficiently prepare you for work. As such, I decided to continue studying different subjects to improve as a data engineer, software engineer and data scientist. Beside working on practical projects with some friends, here are some textbooks or classes I aim to read or complete in the next year:
* Pragmatic Programmer
* Coursera's Statistic course
* Design Patters: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software (we only rapidly covered it at McGill)
